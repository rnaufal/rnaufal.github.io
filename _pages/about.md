My name is Rafael Naufal and I’m a brazilian software enginner. I was graduated in Computer Science at [PUC-SP](https://www.pucsp.br/cce/) and I concluded a post graduation course on Software Engineering at [ITA](https://www.ita.br). This blog is for share software development ideas in general. It’s also intended to motivate the learning of some programming languages such as [Python](https://www.python.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) and programming paradigms as well.

My interests in software development are:

- [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
- [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
- [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) values
- [UML](https://www.uml.org/)
- [Refactoring](https://www.refactoring.com/)

My main experience revolves around the [Java](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) platform.

In my spare time, I like to take photos, travel and read books.
