[CRN](http://www.crn.com/sections/breakingnews/breakingnews.jhtml;?articleId=193600331) is announcing that Sun is set to put [JavaMe](http://java.sun.com/javame/index.jsp) and [J2SE](http://java.sun.com/javase/) under the [GPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) license. Last months Sun commented about putting its Java plataform under a public license, but they were deciding which license to put Java into. Now the preferred choice is GPL. I think it's to promote and increase Sun's reputation in the open-source community. However, as the new said, a GPL license would require those developers making changes to the core Java platform to freely release their code. What do you think about this? Has Sun made the right choice? And what about Apache's license?
