[JFileContentManager](http://fcmanager.wiki.sourceforge.net) is a [Java](http://java.sun.com) based file manager desktop application, it can show, edit and manipulate the content of the files archived inside a zip. 
Showing a simple and friendly GUI, the user can see the content archived inside a zip file in a tree view way, select one file per time and see their content (either _text_ or _image_). It's also possible to reopen the _last_ opened zip files through the _history_ option on the file menu.

Below are the current **features**:



  * See the zip files' list in a tree view way;
  * Select one by one of the files and see their content (either _text_ or _image_); 
  * Open the _last_ four opened zip files through the _history_ option on the file menu and
  * Download the bundled executable Jar.
  
and future **goals:**  
  


  * Support other file formats, like  _.tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .gzip, .rar, .7z_.
  * Edit the content of a _text_ file;
  * Save the edition etiher inside the opened zip or at another location on the disk;
  * Select one or more files and zip them together;
  * Edit the image's file content with the help of a picture toolbar and
  * Bundle the project in Java Web Start.
