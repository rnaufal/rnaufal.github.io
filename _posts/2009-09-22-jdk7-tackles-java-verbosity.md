Interesting [article](http://java.dzone.com/articles/jdk7-tackles-java-verbosity) showing some changes on the Java platform to address its verbosity, but keeping code readability safe.  
I liked the new Collectionâ€™s literals syntax to create lists, sets and maps:

> `List<integer> powersOf2 = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024};</integer>`  
> `Map<string integer=""> ages = {"John" : 35, "Mary" : 28, "Steve" : 42};</string>`

Although it can be possible to use the [DoubleBraceInitialization](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DoubleBraceInitialization) idiom to initialize collections in a more elegant way, this syntax is very terse and concise.

BTW, as I [said](http://rafaelnaufal.com/blog/?p=73#comments) before, [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org) already has a syntactic sugar to create a literal Map:

> `val ages = Map("John" -> 35, "Mary" -> 28,  "Steve" -> 42)`

Maybe this change was taken into account considering the Scala collection literals implementation?
