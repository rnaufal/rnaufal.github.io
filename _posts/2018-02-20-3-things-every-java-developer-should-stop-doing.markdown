My friends [Andre](https://andrematheus.net.br) and [Leonnardo](https://github.com/leonnardo) have sent me an interesting [article](https://dzone.com/articles/3-things-every-java-developer-should-stop-doing) about some bad habits every Java developer should stop doing in their code. 

Basically the author picked up the following points and discussed each one of them, showing code examples why they aren't good practices at all:





  1. Returning Null


  2. Defaulting to Functional Programming


  3. Creating Indiscriminate Getters and Setters



I agree with all these points as being bad practices in Java code. How about you? What do you think about it?
