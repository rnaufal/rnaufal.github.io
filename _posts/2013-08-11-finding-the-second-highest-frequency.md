Itâ€™s been a long time since I posted for the last time, but I promise Iâ€™ll try to keep this blog up-to-date ðŸ™‚

One of the purposes of this blog is to explore new technologies and recently Iâ€™ve been studying [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) solving some puzzles posted by [James Sugrue](http://java.dzone.com/users/jsugrue) on [JavaLobby](http://java.dzone.com/).

The problem is about finding the [second highest frequency](http://java.dzone.com/articles/thursday-code-puzzler-second) of a character in a String. Below is the Ruby code, using the powerful concept of Ruby [closures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_science%29).

```ruby
v="aabbbc".chars;h=Hash[v.map{|k| [k, v.count(k)] }];max=h.values.max;found=h.select { |k, v| v < max};found.keys.first if found
```

For the input String `"aabbbc"`, the result is `"a"`. I could done it in a more [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) style, but I chose a more concise solution :-)

If you have another version in Ruby, feel free to post a comment!
