Some days ago I was trying to customize my blogâ€™s look and feel to remove my pic from each one of my entries.  
At my blogâ€™s theme, every `<img>` tag (which contains my pic for each entry) is the first child of a `<td>` tag.  
I discovered a very handy [CSS2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) selector syntax to accomplish this task:

> E:first-child: Matches element E when E is the firstchild of its parent ([The :first-child pseudo-class](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#first-child))

So, the custom CSS ended up being `td > img:first-child {display: none;}`, which removes my user pic from every post, but keep the one on the left sidebar.

Just now you are seeing only one pic of mine ðŸ™‚
