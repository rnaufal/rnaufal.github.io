Hi! This is my first post on my blog. I'm a software developer and I'm here to share discussions on software development in general. I was graduated in Computer Science at [PUC](http://www.pucsp.br/cce/) and nowadays I'm working as a Java software developer and doing a post graduation course on [ Software Engeneering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering) at [ITA](http://www.ita.cta.br/), in Sao Paulo, Brazil. This blog is intended to promote some software thoughts and discussions. So, share with me your feelings with the software world!
