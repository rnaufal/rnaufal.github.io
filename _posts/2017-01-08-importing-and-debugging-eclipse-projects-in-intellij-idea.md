Last week I faced a situation to import some [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/) projects to [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), my default Java IDE. IntelliJ IDEA supports this integration, just go to `File > New > Project from Existing Sourcesâ€¦` and select a directory where Eclipse *.project* or *.classpath* files are located.

The project was imported successfully, it had some test compilation errors and it was all done for that moment. But, after running the project, I noted that I couldnâ€™t debug some classes as well as I got used at Eclipse.

It was because, by default, IntelliJ IDEA uses the [javac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javac) compiler and Eclipse has its own Java compiler that is part of [JDT](https://eclipse.org/jdt/core/) core. IntelliJ IDEA doesnâ€™t proceed on code compilation when it finds the first error, even for test code or code that isnâ€™t part of the build. The Eclipse compiler is able to proceed on code compilation even if it has compilation errors, so it is possible to run / debug code that doesnâ€™t compile at all.

The solution, in this case, is to switch IntelliJ IDEA to use the Eclipse compiler. Just go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java compiler` and change the drop down box `"Use compiler:"` to `Eclipse` and that is done.

I did that and now I am able to run / debug the Eclipse project using IntelliJ IDEA very well.

I have found the solution here:

Have you faced a situation like this? Have you done another solution than mine? Drop your comments here! ðŸ™‚
