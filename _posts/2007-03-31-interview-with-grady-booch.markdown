Interesting [interview](http://www.gcn.com/print/25_20/41302-1.html) with Grady Booch, an IBM fellow who developed the first drafts of [OOP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and the [Booch Method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booch_method), which was a precursor to [UML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language).  In this interview, he explains why most companies are wrong in doing what they called [SOA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture). Moreover, he says why UML was created and what he does now at IBM. Very nice.
