Funny [news](http://australianit.news.com.au/articles/0,7204,19345228%5E15865%5E%5Enbv%5E,00.html) from [AustralianIT](http://australianit.news.com.au/). Even [Steve Ballmer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer) couldn't rid a Windows infected machine from virus, spyware, worms et cetera. Is there any possibility to rely on Microsoft's security yet?
