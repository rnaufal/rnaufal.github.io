Somedays ago I installed [Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/default.aspx) for the first time at my home desktop (I was very worried about the performance of this OS, so I took a long time to give it a try) and because of my disattention I erased my [MBR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record), so my good old grub startup screen no longer appeared.  
I couldnâ€™t boot from my [Kubuntu](http://kubuntu.org/) anymore ( I prefer [KDE](http://www.kde.org/) rather than [Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/) ðŸ™‚ ). So, I googled a little bit and found at the [Ubuntu forum](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351) how to restore grub from a Ubuntu live cd. I restored it with some steps and all went fine! I hope you enjoy this tip!
