The majority of software developers have a language of choice. Some may chose their preferred language based on the paradigm it applies, others may evaluate if the language is static or dynamic, if it has weak / strong typing, nice and interesting language constructs (like [closures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)), [continuations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation)) and other various criteria. My preferred language is [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) (up to now, because I’m studying [Python](http://www.python.org/), and this language is becoming a good candidate to be my language of choice for a lot of reasons, but these will be part of another post :-)), because it’s a good OO language and it offers good opportunities to apply [OOA/D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_oriented), that is, to construct well-designed, maintainable, robust OO systems.  
Therefore a problem can arise: if the developer tries to keep this preference for a specific language / platform in the organization. This can become a passion and every new project the developer is asked to give a opinion the choice will be his/her preferred language, because he/she believes it’s the best language of the world, because he/she got used to the language. If the developer participates in a open-source community and its company decides to chose a proprietary language, the fight with managers is even worse. So, always remember:

- The language of your choice might not be appropriate to solve a specific problem. You have to evaluate other languages / platforms to achieve the best results. It’s your routine as a software developer. Perhaps other language offers a better cost / benefit than your preferred language (You can solve your problem with fewer lines of code with a different language, for example).
- You are in a company to achieve results, not to program in Java, [.NET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_.NET), Python or anything else. Always have this in mind. Don’t let your passion hide your opportunities in a company.

Have you ever seen some situations like these on your development team?
