Pedro da Ros has pointed me an interesting article from [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com) about ways software projects go wrong. [Five Easy Ways to Fail](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20071101/how-hard-could-it-be-five-easy-ways-to-fail.html) shows us five step-guide to ensure software failure:

1. Mistake No. 1: Start with a mediocre team of developers
2. Mistake No. 2: Set weekly milestones
3. Mistake No. 3: Negotiate the deadline
4. Mistake No. 4: Divide tasks equitably
5. Mistake No. 5: Work till midnight.&lt;/li

Have you ever been in any situation like those above?
