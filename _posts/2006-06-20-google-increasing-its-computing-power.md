My friend Marcel Ferreira sent me this [article](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/14/technology/14search.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=c96a72bbc5f90a47&ex=1307937600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss) which says Google is building two brand new data centers, as big as two football fields, on The Dalles, Ore. [Google’s](http://www.google.com) increasing power is reflected in the location of the data centers, near to a hidroeletric dam, in the Columbia river. Nice is “*The cooling plants are essential because of the searing heat produced by so much computing power*” :-).
