[Google](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/11/wheres-my-gphone.html) ended up the mystery and announced a mobile free development platform, called [Android](http://www.openhandsetalliance.com/android_overview.html) and not a GPhone, as someone would expect. This platform leverages the capacity of building rich mobile applications and service, promoting rich content for the consumer. It includes an operating system, user-interface and applications, letting developers build new mobile services equally, in a meaningful way. As Google says,

> “We see Android as an important part of our strategy of furtheringGoogle’s goal of providing access to information to users wherever theyare. We recognize that many among the [multitude of mobile users](http://communities-dominate.blogs.com/brands/2007/01/putting_27_bill.html)around the world do not and may never have an Android-based phone. Ourgoals must be independent of device or even platform. For this reason,Android will complement, but not replace, our longstanding mobilestrategy of developing useful and compelling mobile services anddriving adoption of these products through partnerships with handsetmanufacturers and mobile operators around the world.”
