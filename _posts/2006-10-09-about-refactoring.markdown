From [Objects First With Java's book](http://www.bluej.org/objects-first/):  "Refactoring is the activity of restructuring an existing design to maintain a good class design when the application is modified or extended. Doing good refactoring is as much about thinking in a certain mindset as it is about technical skills. While we make changes and extensions to applications, we should regularly question whether an original class design still represents the best solution. As the functionality changes, arguments for or against certain designs change. What was a good design for a simple application might not be good anymore when some extensions are added. Recognizing these changes and actually making the refactoring modifications to the source code usually saves a lot of time and effort in the end. The earlier we clean up our design, the more work we usually save."
