Some weeks ago I started doing [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with some co-workers basically for two things:

1. code some tasks of an user story
2. get familiar with a new software code base

I haven’t had an opportunity to put this technique in practice a lot before, but I can say it was extremely important and benefit for the project. Sometimes I was the **driver** and sometimes I was the **observer**. The **driver** is the person who starts coding and the **observer** is who starts doing the code review. That point is important: **code review**.

Pair programming encourages the review of the code. Perhaps you won’t have an opportunity to refactor some code as you have when you are pairing with someone. I think code reviews are important because:

- Reviews increase code quality, because there are 2 people thinking at the same task at the same time.
- Refactoring areas arise in the design where improvements are needed
- When you have the strong support of an IDE (as Eclipse), some refactorings (extract method, extract class, introduce parameter) are highly automated
- Code is more read than written, two people reading the code can understand a lot more about the code base
- New ideas arise because of different point of views
- Questions can be solved by the sum of knowledge of the code base

And you? What’s your experience with pair programming?
