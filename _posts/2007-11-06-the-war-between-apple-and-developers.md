[Cédric](http://beust.com/weblog/archives/000467.html) has posted an interesting point of view about the war between Apple and the developers. This war started when [Java](http://java.sun.com/) developers knew [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) doesn’t include Java. Cédric resumed Apple’s position in one paragraph, saying:

> “What is needed in Cupertino is a radical change in attitude. Dropping the elitist behavior is a mandatory path to success for Apple, and listening to hordes of developers banging at your door is a good first step. Apple doesn’t need to implement Java, but they could show a little bit more willingness to work with whoever is interested in helping take their platform to the next level. Dumping Objective C is probably not an option, but making other languages first-class citizens on a top-notch IDE would undoubtedly go to great lengths toward making this goal a reality (ask Microsoft how Visual Basic and Visual Studio worked out for them). I’d start with C++, maybe C and even some sort of Basic. Hell, just swallow your pride and create a Visual Basic clone for Mac OS.”
