[Wikinews ](http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/New_Web_Search_Engine_Uses_Only_User-Generated_Results) has reported a new web search engine called [Jatalla](http://jatalla.com), which uses only user generated submissions as results, is coming soon. It’s a different approach from the search engine leader [Google](http://www.google.com), which rank relevance based in sites that link to a given web page, according to the [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) alghoritm. Let’s wait for the beta version of the search engine, expected to go out in July. One interesting comment is in Jatalla’s [FAQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAQ), which says “*If you believe (as do we!) that humans are still smarter than computers, you have come to the right place.*”
