[Sun](http://www.sun.com) announced it will start open sourcing Java by the end of this year, according to [eweek](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2003567,00.asp). Sun plans to open-source firts the Java C (Java Compiler) and the HotSpot virtual machine, with the bulk of the rest of the code likely to follow in early 2007, including [JavaME](http://java.sun.com/javame/index.jsp). Sun hasn’t decided which licence to choose yet, maybe GNU [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html) (General PublicLicense) or [CDDL](http://www.sun.com/cddl/) (Common Development and Distribution License). What are the benefits of open sourcing Java? What do you think about the compatibility, if we have a lot of distributions of the technology? Nowadays we have this kind of thing with Linux distros, some are incompatible with the others. What’s your opinion about that?
