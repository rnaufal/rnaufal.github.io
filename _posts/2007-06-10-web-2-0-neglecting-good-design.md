[Here](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6653119.stm) is an interesting interview with the usability guru Jakob Nielsen which he says web firms are so emphasized in the hype of Web 2.0 as the “latest fashion” and at the same time the basic principles of webpages usability are always being forgotten. He claims about companies have to focus first in making good practices available like <span style="background-color:yellow;font-weight:bold;font-size:120%;">“making a site easy to use, good search tools, the use of text free of jargon, usability testing and a consideration of design even before the first line of code is written”</span>. Also, Mr Jakob Nielsen says, as a interesting note, <span style="background-color:yellow;font-weight:bold;font-size:120%;">“The idea of community, user generated content and more dynamic web pages are not inherently bad in the same way, they should be secondary to the primary things sites should get right.”</span>
