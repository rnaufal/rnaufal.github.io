I've came across [Vnunet](http://www.vnunet.com/) to a interesting [news](http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2156205/sun-promises-open-source-java) that [Jonathan Schwartz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_I._Schwartz), Sun's new CEO, said that [Sun](http://www.sun.com) will release the source code of [Java](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_programming_language). One point of view is that this announcement would attract more developers to Java technology although this could lead to a lot of Java development communities, the same that occurs to the Linux OS distributions. On the other hand, this can be very interesting to developers who always wanted to explore the Sun's [JVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JVM) code.
