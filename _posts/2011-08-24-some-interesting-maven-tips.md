Here are some [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) tips, extracted from [Javalobby](http://java.dzone.com/articles/5-maven-tips):

- **Maven rf option:** If your project has some modules and the build fails at one of them, itâ€™s possible to run the build only at this module, preventing from running the entire build. You can achieve this behavior by executing this command:
> mvn -rf my-project clean install

- **Maven pl option:** This option allows you to build specific modules instead of building all projects. You can execute the following command to have this behavior:
> mvn -pl my-project-A,my-project-B clean install

This command will build only **my-project-A** and **my-project-B**.
