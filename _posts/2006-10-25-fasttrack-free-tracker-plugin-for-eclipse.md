For those interested in project management stuff, like issue tracking, team collaboration and other team planning resources, there is a free [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) plugin called [Tracker](http://www.polarion.com/fasttrack/index.php), which is intended ( *I didn‚Äôt have time to test it yet üôÇ* ) to manage team development stuff inside Eclipse IDE. It provides, among other things (*which I think are the best ones*):

- Issue tracking and planning for Requirements, Tasks, Change Requests, etc. (called ‚ÄúWork ITems‚Äù)
- Linking of Work Items with other artifacts in the Eclipse workspace
- Search Work Items using the standard Eclipse search facility
- History of Work Items
- Comparison of different historical revisions of any Work Item
- XML data shared via Subversion ‚Äì no complicated database setup, no administration headaches

If you ever tried this plugin, post your feelings and comments here.
