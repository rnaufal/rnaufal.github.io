Great [session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CSfYGsmGEk) in [JavaOne 2017](https://www.oracle.com/javaone/index.html) about [Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html) and lambdas introduced in [JDK8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/).

The session shows many examples of Java code using `forEach()` with side effects and how to refactor them to a functional approach using streams and the [Collectors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Collectors.html) API.

What are your experiences using Streams and lambdas in JDK 8? Are you correctly using the Collectors API?
