I’ve came across [Bruce Eckel’s old weblog](http://mindview.net/WebLog) and found a [post](http://mindview.net/WebLog/log-0019) about [Spybot-Search &amp; Destroy](http://www.spybot.info/en/home/index.html) to eliminate spywares, malwares, trojans from Windows. It’s uncommon from Bruce’s normal entries. Btw, if you are struggling with this (*who are immune to these kind of pragues with Windows?*), try this tool.
