[JCombiner](https://github.com/rnaufal/jcombiner) is a framework to generate combinations of collections for Java. I have written it in [Java 11](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/) using Java 9 modules ([JPMS](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/quick-start)) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) as build tool. [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) are used for unit testing and [Jacoco](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/) for code coverage. [Streams](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html) and the [Collectors](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Collectors.html) API are extensively used throughout the development of JCombiner project. 

Jcombiner's source code is available under [GitHub](https://github.com/rnaufal/jcombiner).

Code examples of its usage can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/rnaufal/jcombiner/blob/master/README.md#usage). More examples can be found on [this](https://github.com/rnaufal/jcombiner/tree/master/client) module inside JCombiner.
