I'm proud to announce that my paper **A Collaborative Support Approach on UML Sequence Diagrams for Aspect-Oriented Software** was added as lecture notes in computer science at SpringerLink. 

At this paper it is presented an extension based on the default UML meta-model, named MIMECORA-DS, to show object-object, object-aspect and aspect-aspect interactions applying the UMLâ€™s sequence diagram.

You can check it out [here](http://www.springerlink.com/content/a683v580865w85t0/).
