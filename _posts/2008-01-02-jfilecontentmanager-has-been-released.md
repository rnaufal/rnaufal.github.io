[JFileContentManager](http://fcmanager.wiki.sourceforge.net) is a [Java](http://java.sun.com) based file manager desktop application, it can show, edit and manipulate the content of the files archived inside a zip.  
Showing a simple and friendly GUI, the user can see the content archived inside a zip file in a tree view way, select one file per time and see their content (either *text* or *image*). It’s also possible to reopen the *last* opened zip files through the *history* option on the file menu.

Below are the current **features**:

- See the zip files’ list in a tree view way;
- Select one by one of the files and see their content (either *text* or *image*);
- Open the *last* four opened zip files through the *history* option on the file menu and
- Download the bundled executable Jar.

and future **goals:**

- Support other file formats, like *.tar, .tgz, .tar.gz, .gzip, .rar, .7z*.
- Edit the content of a *text* file;
- Save the edition etiher inside the opened zip or at another location on the disk;
- Select one or more files and zip them together;
- Edit the image’s file content with the help of a picture toolbar and
- Bundle the project in Java Web Start.
