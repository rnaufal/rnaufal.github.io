Have you ever thought about recording [HD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_video) (high definition video) with a format which can hold up can hold up to 25GB on a single-layer disc? Yeap, this can be achieved with [ Blu-ray](http://www.blu-ray.com/info/), the next-generation optical disc format jointly developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association ([BDA](http://www.blu-raydisc.com/)). There are some nice photos from Blu-ray [players](http://www.blu-ray.com/players/), [recorders](http://www.blu-ray.com/recorders/) and [media](http://www.blu-ray.com/media/) too.
