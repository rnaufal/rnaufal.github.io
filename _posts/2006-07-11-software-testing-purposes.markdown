[James Bach](http://www.satisfice.com/blog/archives/54) has a interesting opinion about testing software systems. I think it's a different opinion from any team project manager or developer. He not only emphasizes the importance of testers but says developers are trying to test software themselves, andfix every bug, before testers even got their first look at it. His software test heuristic is **if it exists, I want to test it**, even if the product is completely inoperable, with a lot of buggy code.  A different opinion, even from mine. As a software developer, I would think to test it before delivering to testers :-) . And in your company, are there software testers? What do they think about it?
